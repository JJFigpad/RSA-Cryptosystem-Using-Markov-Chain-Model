# RSA-Cryptosystem-Using-Markov-Chain-Model
The principal goal of this investigation is to examine the use of stochastic processes and Markov chains in the context of the RSA attack, how and why the probabilistic methods used in the attack work and the results using a small and controlled RSA implementation example.
